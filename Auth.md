# VPlan Authentication Requirements

This document outlines the authentication requirements for the VPlan mobile application (Android).

## Goals

- Provide a seamless and secure authentication experience for users.
- Allow users to sign in using various popular platforms.
- Maintain user sessions across app launches without requiring repeated logins.
- Securely store and manage user authentication tokens.

## User Authentication Methods

The VPlan application will support the following authentication methods:

1.  **OAuth 2.0 Providers:**
    - Google (Gmail)
    - Facebook
    - Yahoo
    - GitHub

## User Registration (First-Time Login)

- When a user authenticates for the first time using any of the supported providers, the application must:
  - Retrieve the user's basic profile information (e.g., username, email).
  - Create a new user record in the application's database.
  - Generate a unique authentication token for the user.
  - Store the token securely on the user's device (local storage).

## Token Management

1.  **Token Generation:**
    - Upon successful authentication (first-time or subsequent), a unique, time-limited (expiry) token must be generated for the user.
    - The token should be a JWT (JSON Web Token) or a similar standard.
2.  **Token Storage:**
    - The token must be stored securely in the user's local storage on the device.
    - Sensitive information should not be stored in plain text.
3.  **Token Expiration:**
    - Each token must have an expiration date/time.
    - The expiration time should be configurable.
4.  **Token Refresh:**
    - Before a token expires, the application must automatically refresh it.
    - The refresh process should be transparent to the user.
    - The refreshed token must be stored locally, replacing the old one, and the new expiration time must be updated.
5.  **Automatic Login:**
    - On app launch, the application must check for a valid (non-expired) token in local storage.
    - If a valid token exists, the user should be automatically logged in, bypassing the authentication screen.
6.  **Sign Out:**
    - When the user explicitly signs out, the locally stored token must be deleted.
    - The user should be redirected to the authentication screen on the next app launch.
7.  **Token Validation**
    - The backend must validate the token on each request.
    - If the token is invalid or expired, the backend must return an error.

## Error Handling

- The application must gracefully handle authentication errors (e.g., invalid credentials, network issues, token refresh failures).
- Appropriate error messages should be displayed to the user.

## Security Considerations

- All communication with authentication providers and the application's backend must be over HTTPS.
- Tokens must be stored securely to prevent unauthorized access.
- Sensitive user data must be protected.

## Future Enhancements

- Consider adding support for other authentication methods (e.g., email/password).
- Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for enhanced security.
