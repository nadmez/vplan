# VPlan: Firebase and Database Implementation Steps

This document outlines the specific steps required to set up Firebase, design the database schema, integrate Firebase with the Expo React Native application, implement authentication, and handle data storage and fetching.

## Firebase and Database Implementation Steps

1.  **Firebase Setup:**

    - Create a new Firebase project in the Firebase console ([https://console.firebase.google.com/](https://console.firebase.google.com/)).
    - Choose either Realtime Database or Firestore as your database solution.
    - Enable the chosen database in your Firebase project.
    - Enable the authentication methods that you will use (e.g. Google, Facebook, Github).
    - Configure the necessary settings for your Android app (e.g., package name, SHA-1 certificate fingerprint).
    - Download the `google-services.json` file and place it in your project's root directory.

2.  **Database Schema:**

    - Design the exact schema for your data.
    - Define the collections (or tables) for each data type (e.g., users, matches, venues, participation).
    - Define the documents (or rows) within each collection.
    - Define the fields (or columns) for each document, including data types (e.g., string, number, boolean, timestamp).
    - Consider relationships between collections (e.g., one-to-many, many-to-many).
    - Define indexes for efficient querying.
    - Define security rules to control data access.

3.  **Firebase Integration:**

    - Integrate the Firebase SDK into your Expo React Native project.
    - Install the necessary Firebase packages (e.g., `@react-native-firebase/app`, `@react-native-firebase/database` or `@react-native-firebase/firestore`, `@react-native-firebase/auth`).
    - Initialize Firebase in your application's entry point.
    - Configure Firebase with your project's credentials.

4.  **Authentication Flow:**

    - Implement the authentication flow using `expo-auth-session` for OAuth 2.0 providers (Google, Facebook, GitHub, Yahoo).
    - Integrate `expo-auth-session` with Firebase Authentication.
    - Handle the authentication process, including redirecting the user to the provider's login page and handling the callback.
    - Store the user's authentication token securely using `expo-secure-store`.
    - Implement token refresh logic to maintain user sessions.
    - Implement sign-out functionality.

5.  **Data Storage:**

    - After successful authentication, start storing user data in the database.
    - Create new user documents in the "users" collection (or table) when a new user registers.
    - Store relevant user information (e.g., user ID, username, email, provider, creation date, last login date).
    - Implement the logic to store match, venue, and participation data.

6.  **Data Fetching:**
    - Implement the logic to fetch data from the database.
    - Retrieve user data, match data, venue data, and participation data as needed.
    - Use appropriate queries to efficiently retrieve the required data.
    - Handle real-time updates from the database.
    - Handle errors and loading states when fetching data.
